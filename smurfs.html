          <p>Today is the day I stepped into the world (for a purpose).Today is the day of realisation.  Okay wait, Too much of suspense? Let me spit out.</p>
<p>I was uncovering my presents. As usual practice, the first gift I did open is my Mom’s. She is long dead, but never forgotten. Her gifts always surprised me, but this time it shocked me.</p>
<p>I opened the cover to figure out a mutilated piece of book.  I opened it to discover the dark hidden truth. My mom mentioned that the world we are living in is not the same it was way back then .They had green trees, lavishing pleasures, eye stunning nature. These words amazed me .Just then lights went off. My uncle ordered me to sleep.  All my protests were in vain. I curled under the sheets and slept dreaming about the glorious past.</p>

 <p>I was determined to read the rest of the book that day. I quickened through the pages. She mentioned that we were a happy family living under the green woods. She never knew that we will be parted because of a cunning species from a devious land. She wrote that the sharp nosed wicked creature stole all her babies, flew off to a far of land. </p>
<p>Pause.. breaths. </p> 
<p>  I have no words. </p>
<p>My uncle matched the descriptions.  So he lied that he is taking care of us as my mother is no more, but she is still alive in another planet!! I pinched myself. Vain, it’s all true, I am not dreaming.</p>
<p>She told me that this uncle is evil and he chose us because we will grow up to become smart humans, and then will help him solve problems in his planet. After that he will destroy us on some pretext. I gaped at the sentence. These ideas are the ones which made my uncle super kind to us. Such a wicked man!! Sorry, a wicked alien.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help sympathising ourselves. Misfortune hit us badly but wait, she did write something. She told me she is revealing the secret which can club us back, a secret to reach her. I went through the details, declined tiredly on to the bed, I could no longer control my sleep, and after all I am a human.

 <p>I called on to a meeting with my four siblings. I slowly narrated the sad story of our past. They couldn’t believe such facts about my uncle but after reasoning out they accepted. They asked me how we can get back to our welcoming home, I revealed – WE NEED TO TRAVEL IN A SPACESHIP! I gave them a piece of paper where an address is shabbily carved. That was the only clue our mom left. So we agreed on a journey to the place the address will lead, the very next day.</p>

 <p> We came to a place with lot of endeavour. But all we could see is the bright light coming out of a rectangular faced door. Lucy, the youngest of all went and touched it, though I kept warning not to. There was a big bang, the door opened. We stepped in to figure out a HUUUGGGEEE spacecraft. I never saw such a thing in my life. My siblings looked astonished. Lucy started hugging its wings; I think she completely loved it. I know things I have to do. We stepped into the spacecraft. Then all of us suddenly screamed. We could see few hundreds of these blue small creatures jumping, hanging and in short, doing weirdest of stuff. Then the biggest of all came up to me. It told me we will be safe.  I felt drowsy and heavy eyed. And off I struck the ground with a bang.</p>

<p> I woke up peacefully, fully relaxed. Only till I realised where I was. I yelled. This woke my siblings. Then entered this blue creature, with a cup of coffee. It introduced it as a SMURF, it informed its duty is to serve our needs in this journey. I couldn’t help believing when it went on with its cute voice. Lucy took the coffee and gulped it announcing her approval of friendship. We all did the same. We spent the day learning about the spacecraft, how it is oxygenated, and operated. These kinds of things excite me. I could see everybody was yawning, they looked gloomy. I realised it is the time to doze. There is no other way to find out, because the sky out there is always mysteriously dark.</p>

  <p> This is the problem travelling in space; we cannot have an account of dates. Boredom struck us. We gathered to entertain ourselves. We suddenly heard a large thumping sound. We raised the blinds, looked through the glass. Oh my Gosh, someone was chasing us. We rushed to the main control room. We could feel the craft was vigorously shaking. Smurfs got terrified too. I was terrified to notice my uncle waving from the other spacecraft. I quickly paced the controls, looking in the map. I realised we were nearing our planet. I struggled through the controller, lowered it as we were reaching OUR HOME. My uncle cursed me in defeat, returned to his planet. Smurfs did tell me that he is forbidden to visit a planet twice. We descended to see a magical world, a woman came running to us. I suddenly realised I was blinded by tears of happiness. All I gave was a kiss on her pale cheeks.  </p>

<p>I REALISED THAT THIS LIFE IS BLINDED WITH GREED FOR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS. FOLKS WOULD DO ANYTHING, EVEN SEPERATE RELATIONS FOR IT. BUT THE REAL JOY IS LIBERTY FROM SUCH PLASTIC LIFE. ONLY THEN, MAN WILL EXPERIENCE REAL BLISS. </p>
